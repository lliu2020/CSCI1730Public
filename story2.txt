NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Europe finally has a deal, and investors are pleased for now.

The day's rally pushed the S&P 500 into positive territory for the year for the first time since Aug. 4. 
The broad index is now on track for its best monthly performance since October 1974.

is headed for its best month since January 1987.
