(CNN) After a string of disappointing debate performances, the presidential campaign of Texas Gov. 
Rick Perry is signaling that Perry might be dialing back his participation in several planned televised 
Republican presidential primary debates. The new tack raises the question: Can a major candidate with 
a track record of weak debate performances pass on nationally televised debates? "I don't think Perry 
can avoid (debating)," CNN contributor and tea party activist Dana Loesch said, "because the debates are 
where he has received a lot of his criticism." Loesch added that Perry has raised substantial campaign 
funds and has rolled out his tax plan and a plan to create more jobs. "(A)nd that's what a lot of people 
wanted to see. We now want to see how aggressive he can be in these debates and whether or not because 
of his performance and rhetorical skills he can turn this into a two-man race" with former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney. But fellow conservative and CNN contributor Will Cain said the prospect of more debating 
is a "no-win proposition" for the Texas governor.
